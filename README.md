# Elm Tailwind Utils

I'm really intersted in Elm and while I am quite terrible at writing CSS, Tailwind makes it a lot easier for me.
I'd like to get this project to a point where _someone_ can find it useful. But, in the end, I'm getting more exposure to Elm
and will continue to work on it as long as I enjoy it.

Feedback is always appreciated! Just drop a message in the Issues.
